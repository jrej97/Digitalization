#
# Placeholder lock workflow for offline/unresolvable environments.
# This repository could not resolve packages from PyPI in the current
# execution environment, so pinned versions are not included here.
#
# On a connected machine, generate this lock file with:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt
#
# Then commit the generated pinned output for thesis-grade reproducibility.
