# Thesis Artifacts Folder

Use this folder to keep reproducible thesis materials grouped by chapter or analysis milestone.

## Placeholder structure

- `exports_example/`: copy CSV/GEXF/summary files produced by the app.
- `gephi_example/`: store Gephi project files and layout presets.
- `screenshots_example/`: store UI and graph screenshots used in thesis figures.

You can duplicate this structure per chapter (for example `chapter_03/exports`).
